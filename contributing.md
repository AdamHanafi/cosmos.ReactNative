# Getting Started

## Making your first contribution
Before you start your awesome work make sure you follow the below steps
1. Create your own `Fork` of the `cosmos.ReactNative repo`
2. Create a new branch with a `branch-name` that starts with your name followed by what feature/issue you are going to add/resolve.
3. Now let your work begin in this new branch of yours and make sure you follow the code style for the project.
4. Once you are done, Send us a pull request on the `develop` branch on the main `cosmos.ReactNative` app repo

## Some key points
* Each feature/issue you work with should have a different branch which should follow the stated naming convention
* Make sure you regularly pull changes from the develop branch, as it will be kept up to date with latest changes.
